**Project Background**
In my bachelor's thesis, I analyzed the medical sector to examine the impact of COVID-19 on medical companies before and during the pandemic.
The analysis was conducted using historical data retrieved from the Financial Modeling Prep API and included:

Building price charts with indicators like RSI, SMA, EMA, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.

Analyzing volatility by comparing volatility charts of different companies.

Studying trading volume and comparing it across companies.

The analysis revealed that the financial indicators, volatility, and trading volume corroborated each other.
When indicators suggested a potential reversal in a company's performance, high volatility indicated significant price changes,
and trading volume reflected the number of trades executed.

**Conclusion**
The comprehensive analysis confirmed that:
 -Financial indicators can predict potential market movements.
 -High volatility often accompanies significant price changes.
 -Trading volume is a crucial metric for understanding market activity.
 -This project demonstrates the interrelatedness of financial indicators, volatility, and trading volume, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts.
